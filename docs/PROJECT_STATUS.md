# League of Legends Smurf Detection Project - Current Status

## Project Overview
A comprehensive web application designed to detect potential League of Legends smurf accounts through advanced statistical analysis and AI-driven pattern recognition. This tool addresses a critical need in competitive gaming by identifying players who may be using alternate accounts to compete at skill levels significantly below their actual ability.

### Problem Statement
Smurf accounts (experienced players using low-ranked alternate accounts) create unfair competitive advantages in League of Legends tournaments and ranked play. Traditional detection methods rely on manual review, which is time-consuming and inconsistent. This project provides an automated, data-driven solution for tournament organizers and competitive gaming communities.

### Target Users
- **Tournament Organizers**: Ensure competitive integrity in esports events
- **League Administrators**: Maintain fair play in organized competitions  
- **Team Managers**: Verify player eligibility and skill authenticity
- **Competitive Gaming Communities**: Protect ranked ladder integrity

### Technical Approach
The application employs a sophisticated multi-factor analysis system that examines:
- **Champion Performance Analytics**: First-time champion usage patterns, win rates, KDA ratios, and CS efficiency
- **Behavioral Pattern Detection**: Summoner spell placement changes and gameplay habit analysis
- **Temporal Analysis**: Suspicious activity gaps and play pattern irregularities
- **Social Network Analysis**: Associations with known high-ELO players

### Key Capabilities
- **Real-time Analysis**: On-demand smurf probability assessment using live Riot API data
- **Intelligent Scoring**: AI-optimized weighted algorithm producing 0-100% probability scores
- **Visual Analytics**: Interactive charts and detailed breakdowns of detection factors
- **Color-coded Risk Assessment**: Immediate visual indication of smurf likelihood
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed analysis reports for tournament administration
- **API-Compliant Data Handling**: Adheres to Riot Games data policies with intelligent caching

### Architecture Highlights
Built with modern web technologies featuring a React TypeScript frontend and Node.js backend, the system operates without persistent data storage, instead using intelligent caching and on-demand API requests to ensure data freshness while respecting rate limits and privacy requirements.
