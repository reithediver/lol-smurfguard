# Technical Specifications

## API Integration
### Rate Limits
- Development API Key: 20 requests per second
- Production API Key: 100 requests per second
- Must implement proper rate limiting in the application
- Must cache responses when possible to minimize API calls

### Data Usage
1. Match Data
   - Can only store match data for 24 hours
   - Must delete match data after 24 hours
   - Can only store aggregate statistics long-term

2. Summoner Data
   - Can store basic summoner information
   - Must refresh data periodically
   - Cannot store sensitive personal information

3. Caching Requirements
   - Must implement caching for all API responses
   - Cache duration should be reasonable (e.g., 5 minutes for summoner data)
   - Must respect cache-control headers from Riot API

## Tournament Integration
### Use Cases
1. Player Vetting
   - New player roster addition verification
   - Tournament eligibility checking
   - Rank restriction enforcement
   - Skill level validation

2. Data Points
   - Account age and history
   - Champion mastery progression
   - Win rates and performance metrics
   - Match history patterns
   - Role preferences and performance

3. Analysis Requirements
   - Cross-reference multiple data points
   - Identify unusual patterns
   - Calculate smurf probability
   - Provide detailed reasoning
   - Generate verification reports
