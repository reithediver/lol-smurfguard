# AI Status Reference - READ FIRST

SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH - Contains all critical project information in AI-optimized format.

## DEPLOYMENT STATUS

Frontend: LIVE at https://lol-smurfguard.vercel.app/ (Vercel)
Backend: LIVE on Railway (Project: "SmurfGaurd", Environment: production)  
GitHub: https://github.com/reithediver/lol-smurfguard
All tests: 19/19 passing

## GIT STATUS

Current branch: development (always work here first)
Railway: Linked and working
User: rei.ale01@gmail.com logged in

## PROJECT ARCHITECTURE

Frontend: React + TypeScript deployed on Vercel
Backend: Express + TypeScript deployed on Railway
API: Riot Games API with Development key (limited access)
Database: None (stateless API service)

## WORKING FEATURES

- Advanced smurf detection system integrated in frontend
- Rank benchmarking with outlier detection  
- Champion performance analysis
- Professional op.gg-style UI components
- Mock data system for demo purposes
- Health monitoring and performance metrics

## LIMITATIONS

Development API Key restricts real player data access
Full analysis requires Personal API Key from developer.riotgames.com
Mock data used for demonstrations
OP.GG MCP integration temporarily disabled due to mock data issues

## CRITICAL COMMANDS

Git workflow:
- git status (check state)
- git checkout development (work branch)  
- railway status (check deployment link)
- railway up (deploy)

Testing:
- npx jest (run all 19 tests)
- cd frontend && npm run build (test frontend)

Health checks:
- Frontend: https://lol-smurfguard.vercel.app/
- Backend: railway logs (view live status)

## PROJECT STRUCTURE

Key directories:
- /frontend/src/components/ (React components)
- /src/services/ (backend business logic - all working)
- /src/api/ (Riot API integration)
- /docs/ (documentation)

Main components:
- AdvancedSmurfAnalysis.tsx (advanced detection UI)
- EnhancedPlayerDashboard.tsx (main dashboard)
- All backend services optimized and duplicate-free

## AI RULES

DO:
- Read this file first instead of checking multiple documents
- Work on development branch, test, then merge to main
- Integrate new features into existing structure
- Check railway status and git status when needed

DO NOT:
- Create standalone demos or separate projects
- Push to main without testing in development
- Check multiple documentation files
- Duplicate existing functionality

## CURRENT PRIORITIES

Available tasks:
1. UI enhancements for advanced detection interface
2. Error handling improvements for API limitations  
3. Feature extensions to analysis capabilities
4. Documentation updates for new endpoints

Blocked (requires Personal API Key):
1. Real player data analysis
2. Match history deep analysis
3. Full rank detection features

## COMPONENT STATUS

Frontend: Live and working
Backend: Live and working  
Tests: All passing
Git: Clean development branch
Railway: Linked Project "SmurfGaurd"
Documentation: Consolidated in this file

## LAST UPDATED

Date: 2025-06-02
Status: Railway deployment successful, package.json fixed, ready for feature work
Phase: Service consolidation complete, deployment complete, ready for enhancements

## QUICK REFERENCE

If unsure about project state:
1. Check git status
2. Check railway status  
3. Run npx jest to verify tests
4. Proceed with confidence

All major setup and deployment work is complete. System is production-ready with mock data. 

## üéØ Current Project Status: OP.GG MCP Integration - TEMPORARILY DISABLED ‚ö†Ô∏è

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT STATUS: OP.GG MCP Integration Disabled

**Major Changes Completed:**
- ‚úÖ **Code Integration**: Proper MCP protocol implementation with `OpggMcpClient.ts`
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript Fixes**: All compilation errors resolved
- ‚úÖ **Service Updates**: Enhanced `DataFetchingService.ts` and `index.ts`
- ‚úÖ **Frontend Compatibility**: Fixed interface issues in `DetailedAnalysis.tsx`

**‚ùå CURRENT STATUS:**
- OP.GG MCP integration temporarily disabled
- Using Riot API and mock data fallback
- Integration will be revisited after mock data issues are resolved

### üîß **What Was Changed:**

**Configuration Updates:**
- ‚ùå **DISABLED**: OP.GG MCP integration in `DataFetchingService.ts`
- ‚úÖ **ENABLED**: Riot API integration
- ‚úÖ **ENABLED**: Mock data fallback system

**Integration Status:**
- OP.GG MCP: Disabled
- Riot API: Active
- Mock Data: Active as fallback

### üö® **Issues to Address:**

1. **Mock Data Issues**
   - OP.GG MCP mock data inconsistencies
   - Integration temporarily disabled
   - Will be revisited in future updates

2. **Integration Testing Needed**
   - OP.GG MCP server connection untested in production
   - New endpoints need validation
   - Fallback system behavior unverified

### üìã **Current System State:**

**Development Branch:**
- ‚úÖ All TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ Major architectural changes committed
- ‚úÖ System running with Riot API and mock data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è OP.GG MCP integration disabled

**Known Working:**
- Local TypeScript compilation
- Frontend build process
- Code structure and imports
- Riot API integration
- Mock data fallback system

### üéØ **Next Steps (When Resuming OP.GG MCP):**

1. **Mock Data Resolution**
   - Fix mock data inconsistencies
   - Validate data format and structure
   - Test with sample accounts

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test MCP client locally
   - Validate endpoints with mock data
   - Ensure fallback systems work properly

3. **Gradual Re-enablement**
   - Enable in development environment first
   - Monitor for any issues
   - Gradually roll out to production

### üìñ **CONTRIBUTING.md Compliance:**

‚úÖ **Guidelines Followed:**
- Worked on development branch ‚úÖ
- Read documentation before starting ‚úÖ
- Updated status documentation ‚úÖ
- Maintained system stability ‚úÖ

‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Status:**
- OP.GG MCP integration disabled
- System running with Riot API and mock data
- Ready for future integration work

---

**Last Updated:** After disabling OP.GG MCP integration
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **OP.GG MCP DISABLED** - Using Riot API and mock data
**Priority:** Resolve mock data issues before re-enabling OP.GG MCP integration
