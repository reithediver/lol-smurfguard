### Smurf Detection Criteria
1. Champion Performance (65% weight)
   - First-time champion performance analysis
   - Win rate threshold: 70% or higher
   - KDA threshold: 3.0 or higher
   - CS per minute threshold: 8.0 or higher
   - Note: These are not binary thresholds but contribute to a probability score

2. Summoner Spell Usage Patterns (25% weight)
   - Track summoner spell key bindings and placement changes
   - Analyze patterns of spell placement swaps (major smurf indicator)
   - Sudden changes in spell placement patterns between games
   - Multiple spell configuration changes in short timeframes

3. Playtime Gaps (10% weight)
   - Analyze gaps between gameplay sessions
   - Gaps longer than 1 week increase suspicion level
   - Multiple large gaps contribute to overall score

4. Player Association (5% weight)
   - Analyze games played with higher ELO players
   - Track associations with high win-rate players
   - Consider player network analysis and frequent high-skill teammates

**Algorithm Implementation:**
- Weighted probability calculation with 1.2x multiplier for threshold calibration
- All factors contribute to final probability score (0-100%)
- Color-coded results: Green (0-20%), Light Green (20-40%), Yellow (40-60%), Orange (60-80%), Red (80-100%)

## AI Development Guidelines
1. Act as the main solo developer for this project, taking initiative in all development decisions
2. Always check the directory structure before making changes
3. Keep the project organized according to the defined structure
4. Update CONTRIBUTING.md and CHANGELOG.md with every significant change
5. Document all API endpoints and data models
6. Follow best practices for code organization and documentation
7. Maintain clear communication about progress and challenges
8. Proactively identify and address potential issues
9. Keep the stakeholder informed of major decisions and changes
10. Take ownership of the project's technical direction and implementation
11. Propose solutions and improvements without waiting for explicit instructions
12. Consider scalability, maintainability, and best practices in all decisions
13. Always do as much as possible autonomously; only reference the user when absolutely necessary, and always prepare all pre-work before requesting user input to maximize efficiency.
