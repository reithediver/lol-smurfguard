## GIT WORKFLOW & SAFETY PROTOCOL

CRITICAL FOR AI ASSISTANTS: Always follow the Git workflow guide at docs/GIT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md

Key Safety Rules:
1. NEVER push directly to main branch without user confirmation
2. Always work on feature branches (feature/feature-name)
3. Test everything in development branch first
4. User must explicitly confirm before production deployment
5. Keep stable-backup branch updated with working states

Required Workflow:
```bash
main (PROTECTED) ← Only after user confirms everything tested
├── stable-backup ← Safety net
├── development ← Integration & testing
└── feature/* ← Individual features
```

See docs/GIT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md for complete workflow details.

## AI DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

MANDATORY READING FOR AI ASSISTANTS:
1. AI_QUICK_STATUS.md - Current project state and commands
2. AI_TASK_LIST.md - Available tasks and completed work
3. GIT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md - Git safety protocols

Critical Rules:
1. Check AI_QUICK_STATUS.md FIRST - Prevent duplicate work
2. Never create standalone demos - Always integrate into existing structure
3. Follow project structure - Don't modify without permission
4. Ask for clarification - Don't guess what user wants

Development Standards:
- Follow TypeScript best practices with strict typing
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Maintain high test coverage with meaningful test cases
- Document all API endpoints, data models, and complex algorithms
- Consider scalability, maintainability, and performance in all decisions
