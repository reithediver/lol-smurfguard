# League of Legends Smurf Detection Tool

A comprehensive web application that analyzes League of Legends player behavior patterns to detect potential smurf accounts. Built for tournament organizers and competitive integrity.

## üéØ Project Overview

This tool helps tournament organizers and community administrators identify potential smurf accounts by analyzing:
- Champion performance patterns
- Playtime gaps and activity patterns
- Summoner spell usage changes
- Player association networks
- Skill progression anomalies

## üöÄ Features

### Core Detection Algorithms
- **Champion Performance Analysis**: Detects unusually high performance on low-playtime champions
- **Playtime Gap Detection**: Identifies suspicious gaps in gameplay activity
- **Summoner Spell Pattern Analysis**: Tracks changes in spell placement and usage
- **Player Association Mapping**: Analyzes connections with high-ELO players
- **Skill Progression Monitoring**: Detects unnatural skill improvements

### User Interface
- Modern, responsive web interface
- Real-time analysis with progress indicators
- Color-coded probability indicators
- Detailed breakdown of detection factors
- Mobile-friendly design

### Technical Features
- TypeScript for type safety
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Rate limiting and caching
- Error handling and retry logic
- Configurable detection thresholds

### 4. Get a Riot API Key

#### Development Key (Immediate)
1. Visit [Riot Developer Portal](https://developer.riotgames.com/)
2. Sign in with your Riot account
3. Generate a development key (24-hour expiration)
4. Add it to your `.env` file

#### Production Key (For Public Use)
1. Apply for a production key at the developer portal
2. Provide a working website/application
3. Include Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
4. Wait for approval (can take several days)

### 5. Start the Application

#### Development Mode
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

#### Production Mode
```bash
# Build frontend
cd frontend
npm run build
cd ..

# Start production server
npm start
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001

## üéÆ Usage

### Basic Analysis
1. Open the web application
2. Enter a player name in the format: `PlayerName#TAG`
3. Click "Analyze Player"
4. Review the smurf probability and detailed analysis

### Understanding Results

#### Probability Levels
- **Very Low (0-20%)**: Legitimate player
- **Low (20-40%)**: Minimal suspicion
- **Moderate (40-60%)**: Some suspicious patterns
- **High (60-80%)**: Likely smurf account
- **Very High (80-100%)**: Strong smurf indicators

#### Detection Factors
- **Champion Performance**: High win rates on new champions
- **Playtime Gaps**: Long periods of inactivity
- **Summoner Spells**: Changes in spell placement patterns
- **Player Associations**: Games with high-ELO players

## üß™ Testing

```bash
npm test
```

### Run Specific Test Suites
```bash
# Backend tests only
npm run test:backend

# Frontend tests only

## üìä API Documentation

### Analyze Player
```http
POST /api/analyze
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "playerName": "PlayerName#TAG",
  "region": "na1",
  "gameCount": 50
}
```

### Get Player Info
```http
GET /api/player/{region}/{playerName}
```

### Health Check
```http
GET /api/health
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Detection Thresholds
Adjust sensitivity in `.env`:
- `SMURF_WIN_RATE_THRESHOLD`: Win rate threshold (0.0-1.0)
- `SMURF_KDA_THRESHOLD`: KDA threshold
- `SMURF_CS_THRESHOLD`: CS per minute threshold
- `SMURF_GAP_HOURS`: Suspicious gap duration in hours

### Algorithm Weights
Fine-tune detection factors:
- `SMURF_WEIGHT_GAPS`: Playtime gap importance
- `SMURF_WEIGHT_PERFORMANCE`: Champion performance importance
- `SMURF_WEIGHT_SPELLS`: Summoner spell pattern importance
- `SMURF_WEIGHT_ASSOCIATIONS`: Player association importance
- `SMURF_WEIGHT_PROGRESSION`: Skill progression importance

**Note**: All weights must sum to 1.0

## üö® Rate Limiting & API Guidelines

### Development Key Limits
- 20 requests per second
- 100 requests per 2 minutes

### Production Key Limits
- 500 requests per 10 seconds
- 30,000 requests per 10 minutes

### Best Practices
- Implement caching for repeated requests
- Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff
- Monitor rate limit headers
- Cache match data for 24 hours maximum (Riot requirement)

## üîí Data Privacy & Compliance

### Riot API Terms
- Match data must be deleted after 24 hours
- Only aggregate statistics can be stored long-term
- Personal information cannot be stored
- Must respect player privacy

### GDPR Compliance
- No personal data storage
- Data processing for legitimate interests only
- Clear privacy policy required for production

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Player not found"
- Verify player name format: `Name#TAG`
- Check if player exists in the specified region
- Ensure API key is valid

#### Rate limit exceeded
- Wait for rate limit reset
- Implement proper caching
- Consider upgrading to production key

#### API key invalid
- Check if development key has expired (24 hours)
- Verify key is correctly set in `.env`
- Ensure no extra spaces or characters

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging:
```env
LOG_LEVEL=debug
DEV_DEBUG=true
```
